# Required Adjustments for Converting from Create React App to Vite

Based on the examination of the frontend files and loveable.dev feedback, the following adjustments are required to convert the frontend from Create React App (CRA) to Vite:

## 1. Package.json Updates

- Update dependencies to include Vite and related packages
- Replace react-scripts with Vite-specific scripts
- Add TypeScript support (if needed)
- Update browserslist configuration to Vite format

## 2. Index.html Relocation

- Move index.html from public/ directory to the root directory
- Update the index.html content to include Vite-specific module loading
- Add proper script tags for Vite entry point

## 3. Create Vite Configuration

- Create a new vite.config.js or vite.config.ts file in the root directory
- Configure React plugin
- Set up proper build and development settings
- Configure asset handling

## 4. Entry Point Adjustments

- Update src/index.js to work with Vite's module system
- Ensure proper import paths for CSS and other assets
- Adjust any CRA-specific code to work with Vite

## 5. Static Assets Handling

- Move relevant files from public/ to appropriate locations
- Update references to static assets in the code

## 6. Environment Variables

- Convert any CRA-specific environment variable usage (REACT_APP_*) to Vite format (VITE_*)
- Create .env files if needed

## 7. Build Output Configuration

- Configure proper output directory in vite.config.js
- Ensure build scripts generate the expected output structure

These adjustments will ensure that the frontend project is properly structured for loveable.dev to analyze and work with it as a Vite project.
