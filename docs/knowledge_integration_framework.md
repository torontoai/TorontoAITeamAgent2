# Knowledge Integration Framework for TORONTO AI Team Agent

This document provides an overview of the sophisticated vector-based knowledge integration system implemented for the TORONTO AI Team Agent. The system enables agents to access and utilize training materials, certification content, and other knowledge sources to enhance their capabilities.

## Overview

The knowledge integration framework consists of several key components:

1. **Vector Database System**: A flexible system supporting multiple vector database backends (InMemory, ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, FAISS) with hybrid search capabilities.

2. **Knowledge Extraction Pipeline**: An advanced pipeline for extracting knowledge from training materials with sophisticated chunking strategies and multi-modal support.

3. **Agent Adaptation Layer**: A system for integrating knowledge retrieval capabilities into agent roles with personalization and knowledge sharing.

4. **Certification Content Mechanism**: A mechanism for managing certification content, including Google Project Manager and IBM Product Manager certifications.

5. **CLI Interface**: A comprehensive command-line interface for managing the training system.

6. **Integration Module**: A module for integrating all components and connecting with the agent system.

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openmanus-team-ai.git
cd openmanus-team-ai

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

The system can be configured using the CLI:

```bash
# Show current configuration
python -m app.training.cli config --show

# Update configuration
python -m app.training.cli config --vector_db_type chroma --chunking_strategy semantic
```

### Processing Training Materials

```bash
# Process all training materials
python -m app.training.cli extract

# Process a specific file
python -m app.training.cli extract --file /path/to/material.md
```

### Managing Certification Content

```bash
# Create certification template
python -m app.training.cli certification template --type google_project_manager

# Add certification content
python -m app.training.cli certification add --type google_project_manager --path /path/to/content

# Process certification content
python -m app.training.cli certification process --id <content_id>
```

### Adapting Agent Roles

```bash
# Adapt agent role
python -m app.training.cli adapt --role project_manager
```

### Querying Knowledge

```bash
# Query knowledge base
python -m app.training.cli query "project management best practices"
```

## Adding Google Project Manager and IBM Product Manager Certification Content

The system includes a mechanism for easily adding Google Project Manager and IBM Product Manager certification content:

1. Create a template:
   ```bash
   python -m app.training.cli certification template --type google_project_manager
   ```

2. Fill in the template with your certification content.

3. Add the content to the system:
   ```bash
   python -m app.training.cli certification add --type google_project_manager --path /path/to/content
   ```

4. Process the content:
   ```bash
   python -m app.training.cli certification process --id <content_id>
   ```

## Integration with Agent System

To integrate the knowledge integration framework with the agent system:

```python
from app.training.integration import integration

# Integrate with agent system
result = integration.integrate_with_agent_system("app.agent.base_agent")

# Process all training materials
integration.process_all_training_materials()

# Adapt agent roles
integration.adapt_all_agent_roles(["project_manager", "product_manager", "developer"])
```

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive integration tests:

```bash
# Run integration tests
python -m app.training.tests.integration_tests
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

- Support for additional vector database backends
- Enhanced multi-modal capabilities
- Integration with external knowledge sources
- Improved personalization algorithms
- Advanced analytics and reporting
