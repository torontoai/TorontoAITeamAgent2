## Automated Deployment System

The Automated Deployment System enables agents to deploy code without human intervention, streamlining the deployment process and reducing the need for manual operations.

### Key Features

- **Environment-Specific Deployment**: Configure different deployment environments (development, staging, production) with customized settings
- **Pre-Deployment Checks**: Automated testing, security scanning, and type checking before deployment
- **Docker Integration**: Automated building and deployment of Docker containers
- **Deployment History**: Tracking of all deployments with detailed information
- **Approval Workflows**: Optional approval requirements for sensitive environments

### Usage

```python
from app.deployment.automated_system import AutomatedDeploymentSystem

# Initialize the system
deployment_system = AutomatedDeploymentSystem()

# Deploy code to development environment
result = await deployment_system.deploy_code({
    "repo_path": "/path/to/repository",
    "environment": "development",
    "version": "1.0.0"
})

# Check deployment history
history = await deployment_system.get_deployment_history()

# Get environment status
status = await deployment_system.get_environment_status("production")
```

### Configuration

The Automated Deployment System can be configured with the following options:

```yaml
deployment:
  environments:
    development:
      url: http://localhost:8000
      auto_deploy: true
      requires_approval: false
    staging:
      url: https://staging.example.com
      auto_deploy: true
      requires_approval: true
    production:
      url: https://production.example.com
      auto_deploy: false
      requires_approval: true
```

## Autonomous GitHub Integration

The Autonomous GitHub Integration system enables agents to keep code updated on GitHub without human intervention, automating code commits, pushes, and repository management.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Commits**: Periodically commit changes based on configurable intervals
- **Automatic Pushes**: Push committed changes to GitHub automatically
- **Branch Management**: Support for different branches with protection for critical branches
- **Pre-Push Checks**: Run tests before pushing to protected branches
- **Repository Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for changes with configurable actions
- **Activity Tracking**: Detailed history of all GitHub activities

### Usage

```python
from app.deployment.github_integration import AutonomousGitHubIntegration

# Initialize the system
github_integration = AutonomousGitHubIntegration()

# Set up repository for autonomous integration
result = await github_integration.setup_repository({
    "repo_path": "/path/to/repository",
    "github_url": "https://github.com/username/repository.git",
    "github_token": "your_github_token",
    "auto_commit": True,
    "auto_push": True
})

# Commit changes manually (also happens automatically)
commit_result = await github_integration.commit_changes({
    "repo_path": "/path/to/repository",
    "message": "Update documentation",
    "push": True
})

# Check GitHub activity history
history = await github_integration.get_activity_history()
```

### Configuration

The Autonomous GitHub Integration system can be configured with the following options:

```yaml
github:
  auto_commit: true
  auto_push: true
  commit_message_prefix: "[Auto] "
  default_branch: main
  commit_interval: 3600  # 1 hour
