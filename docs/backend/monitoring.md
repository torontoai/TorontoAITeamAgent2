# Backend Monitoring Guide

This document provides detailed instructions for monitoring the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT backend system to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and security.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:
- Completed the [Installation](../getting-started/installation.md) process
- Configured the backend as described in [Backend Configuration](./configuration.md)
- Basic understanding of monitoring concepts and tools

## Monitoring Components

The TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system includes several monitoring components:

### System Metrics Monitoring

The system collects and analyzes the following metrics:

- **CPU Usage**: Per-process and system-wide CPU utilization
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption by component
- **Disk I/O**: Read/write operations and throughput
- **Network Traffic**: Inbound and outbound traffic
- **API Latency**: Response time for API endpoints
- **Request Rate**: Number of requests per minute
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests

### Agent Performance Monitoring

Agent-specific metrics include:

- **Response Time**: Time taken by agents to respond to queries
- **Token Usage**: Number of tokens consumed by each agent
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of successfully completed tasks
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed agent operations
- **Knowledge Retrieval Performance**: Metrics for knowledge retrieval operations

### Vector Database Monitoring

Vector database metrics include:

- **Query Latency**: Time taken to execute vector queries
- **Index Size**: Size of vector indices
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Percentage of queries served from cache
- **Embedding Generation Time**: Time taken to generate embeddings
- **Storage Usage**: Storage consumed by vector database

## Monitoring Setup

### Basic Monitoring Setup

For development and testing environments:

```bash
# Start the monitoring service
python -m app.monitoring.monitor_service

# View real-time metrics
python -m app.monitoring.metrics_viewer
```

### Production Monitoring Setup

For production environments, we recommend using Prometheus and Grafana:

1. **Install Prometheus and Grafana**:

```bash
# Using Docker Compose
cd deployment/monitoring
docker-compose up -d
```

2. **Configure Prometheus**:

Edit `prometheus.yml` to include your targets:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'toronto_ai_team_agent'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']
```

3. **Configure Grafana**:

- Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000
- Add Prometheus as a data source
- Import the pre-built dashboards from `deployment/monitoring/dashboards/`

### Log Monitoring

The system generates logs at different levels:

```bash
# View application logs
tail -f logs/application.log

# View error logs
tail -f logs/error.log

# View agent interaction logs
tail -f logs/agent_interactions.log
```

For production environments, we recommend using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):

```bash
# Using Docker Compose
cd deployment/monitoring/elk
docker-compose up -d
```

## Alerting Configuration

### Basic Alerting

Configure email alerts for critical issues:

```bash
# Edit alerting configuration
nano config/alerting.json
```

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "email_alerts": {
    "enabled": true,
    "smtp_server": "smtp.example.com",
    "smtp_port": 587,
    "username": "alerts@example.com",
    "password": "your_password",
    "recipients": ["admin@example.com"]
  },
  "alert_rules": [
    {
      "name": "high_cpu_usage",
      "condition": "cpu_usage > 90",
      "duration": "5m",
      "severity": "critical"
    },
    {
      "name": "high_error_rate",
      "condition": "error_rate > 5",
      "duration": "1m",
      "severity": "critical"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Advanced Alerting with Prometheus Alertmanager

For production environments, configure Alertmanager:

1. **Edit Alertmanager configuration**:

```bash
nano deployment/monitoring/alertmanager/config.yml
```

2. **Define alert rules in Prometheus**:

```bash
nano deployment/monitoring/prometheus/rules/toronto_ai_team_agent.yml
```

Example rules:

```yaml
groups:
- name: toronto_ai_team_agent
  rules:
  - alert: HighCpuUsage
    expr: cpu_usage > 90
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High CPU usage detected"
      description: "CPU usage is above 90% for 5 minutes"
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: error_rate > 5
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High error rate detected"
      description: "Error rate is above 5% for 1 minute"
```

## Performance Dashboards

The system includes pre-built dashboards for monitoring performance:

### System Dashboard

The system dashboard provides an overview of system health:

- CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Request rate and latency
- Error rate and status codes
- Active connections

Access the dashboard at:
- Development: http://localhost:8000/monitoring/system
- Production: https://your-domain.com/monitoring/system

### Agent Dashboard

The agent dashboard provides insights into agent performance:

- Response time by agent
- Token usage by agent
- Completion rate by agent
- Error rate by agent

Access the dashboard at:
- Development: http://localhost:8000/monitoring/agents
- Production: https://your-domain.com/monitoring/agents

### Vector Database Dashboard

The vector database dashboard provides insights into vector database performance:

- Query latency
- Index size
- Cache hit rate
- Storage usage

Access the dashboard at:
- Development: http://localhost:8000/monitoring/vector-db
- Production: https://your-domain.com/monitoring/vector-db

## Performance Analysis

### Identifying Performance Bottlenecks

Use the following tools to identify performance bottlenecks:

```bash
# Run performance analysis
python -m app.monitoring.performance_analyzer

# Generate performance report
python -m app.monitoring.performance_report
```

### Profiling

For detailed profiling:

```bash
# Profile API endpoints
python -m app.monitoring.api_profiler

# Profile agent operations
python -m app.monitoring.agent_profiler

# Profile vector database operations
python -m app.monitoring.vector_db_profiler
```

## Troubleshooting Monitoring Issues

### Common Monitoring Issues

1. **Missing Metrics**: If metrics are missing:
   - Check if the monitoring service is running
   - Verify that the metrics endpoint is accessible
   - Check for errors in the monitoring service logs

2. **High Resource Usage by Monitoring**: If the monitoring system itself is consuming too many resources:
   - Reduce the collection frequency
   - Limit the number of metrics collected
   - Optimize the storage backend

3. **Alert Fatigue**: If you're receiving too many alerts:
   - Adjust alert thresholds
   - Implement alert grouping
   - Set up alert severity levels
