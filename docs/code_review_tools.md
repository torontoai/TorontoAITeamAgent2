Documentation for Code Review Tools in TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT

This document provides detailed information about the code review tools integrated
into the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system.
"""

## Overview

The TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system includes a comprehensive suite of code review and quality assurance tools
that help maintain high code quality, enforce coding standards, detect bugs, and identify security vulnerabilities.
These tools are integrated into the development workflow and can be used both manually and as part of automated
CI/CD pipelines.

## Static Analysis Tools

### Pylint

Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool that checks for errors, enforces coding standards,
looks for code smells, and can make suggestions about how to refactor code.

#### Key Features
- Error detection
- Coding standard enforcement (PEP 8)
- Refactoring suggestions
- Duplicate code detection
- Design pattern violation detection
- Customizable through configuration files

#### Usage Example
```python
from app.tools.analysis.pylint import PylintTool

pylint = PylintTool()
result = pylint.analyze("/path/to/your/code.py")

print(f"Pylint score: {result.score}/10")
for issue in result.issues:
    print(f"{issue.code}: {issue.message} at line {issue.line}")
```

### Flake8

Flake8 is a Python tool that combines PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and Ned Batchelder's McCabe script.
It checks for logical errors, style violations, and code complexity.

#### Key Features
- PEP 8 style guide enforcement
- Syntax error detection
- Unused import detection
- Variable assignment detection
- Cyclomatic complexity checking
- Plugin system for extensibility

#### Usage Example
```python
from app.tools.formatting.flake8 import Flake8Tool

flake8 = Flake8Tool()

for issue in result.issues:
    print(f"{issue.code}: {issue.message} at line {issue.line}")
```

## Code Formatting Tools

### Black

Black is an uncompromising Python code formatter that reformats entire files in place.

for issue in result.issues:
    print(f"{issue.severity}: {issue.message} at line {issue.line}")
```

## Security Tools

### Bandit

Bandit is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code, such as
injection vulnerabilities, weak cryptography, and insecure permissions.

#### Key Features
- Detection of common security vulnerabilities

- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Detailed reports with remediation advice
- Support for ignoring false positives

#### Usage Example
```python
from app.tools.security.bandit import BanditTool

bandit = BanditTool()
result = bandit.scan("/path/to/your/code.py")

for issue in result.issues:
    print(f"{issue.severity} {issue.confidence}: {issue.message} at line {issue.line}")
```

## Agentic Coding Tools

result = aider.assist(
    prompt="Add input validation to this function",
    code_context="/path/to/your/code.py",
    git_repo="/path/to/your/repo"
)

print(result.suggested_code)
print(result.explanation)
```

## Integration with CI/CD

All code review tools can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate code quality checks
and prevent issues from being merged into the main codebase.

### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
name: Code Quality Checks

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  code-quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install pylint black flake8 mypy bandit pytest
    - name: Run Black
      run: black --check .
    - name: Run Flake8
      run: flake8 .
    - name: Run Pylint
      run: pylint --disable=C0111 app/
    - name: Run Mypy
      run: mypy app/
    - name: Run Bandit
      run: bandit -r app/
    - name: Run Tests
      run: pytest
```

## Best Practices

1. **Integrate Early**: Run code review tools from the beginning of development
2. **Automate**: Set up pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines to run tools automatically
3. **Customize**: Adjust tool configurations to match project requirements
4. **Prioritize**: Focus on high-severity issues first
5. **Document Exceptions**: When ignoring tool warnings, document the reason
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update tool configurations as the project evolves
7. **Team Consensus**: Ensure the team agrees on coding standards and tool configurations
8. **Training**: Educate team members on how to interpret and address tool feedback

## Conclusion

The code review tools integrated into the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system provide comprehensive
coverage for code quality, style, type safety, and security. By leveraging these tools,
development teams can maintain high-quality codebases, reduce bugs, and improve overall
software reliability.
