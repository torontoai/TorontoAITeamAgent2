# Agent Training Pipeline Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a comprehensive Agent Training Pipeline that leverages the Coursera API to enhance the capabilities of agent roles in the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system. The pipeline will systematically acquire, process, and integrate educational content from Coursera into the agent knowledge framework, enabling continuous learning and specialization for different agent roles.

## Architecture

### High-Level Components

The Agent Training Pipeline consists of five main components:

1. **Content Acquisition System**: Interfaces with the Coursera API to retrieve educational content
2. **Content Processing Engine**: Transforms raw content into structured knowledge
3. **Knowledge Integration Framework**: Incorporates processed content into the agent knowledge base
4. **Role-Specific Training Manager**: Maps knowledge to specific agent roles and capabilities
5. **Training Effectiveness Evaluation**: Measures and optimizes the impact of training
