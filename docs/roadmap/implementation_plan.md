   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing throughout implementation, optimization as needed

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - **Risk**: Limited resources may delay implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Clear prioritization, focus on Wave 1 items first

4. **Technical Debt**
   - **Risk**: Rapid implementation may create technical debt
   - **Mitigation**: Code reviews, adherence to coding standards, comprehensive testing

5. **External System Dependencies**
   - **Risk**: Jira/Confluence API changes may impact integration
   - **Mitigation**: Implement abstraction layer, monitor API changes, develop fallback mechanisms

## Success Criteria
