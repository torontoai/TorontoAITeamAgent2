# Human-AI Collaboration Framework Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a comprehensive Human-AI Collaboration Framework for the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system. The framework will enable seamless collaboration between AI agents and human team members within a unified hierarchical structure, allowing for efficient project execution with mixed teams.

## Core Principles

1. **Equal Participation**: Human and AI team members should be treated as equal participants in the project workflow
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: A well-defined hierarchical structure should establish reporting relationships and decision authority
3. **Role-Based Capabilities**: Permissions and capabilities should be based on roles rather than whether a team member is human or AI
4. **Adaptive Communication**: Communication patterns should adapt to the preferences and needs of both human and AI team members
5. **Transparent Attribution**: All contributions should be clearly attributed to their source (human or AI)
6. **Flexible Configuration**: The framework should support different team structures and hierarchies based on project needs

## Framework Components

### 1. Team Hierarchy Model

#### Hierarchical Structure
- **Project Level**: Overall project leadership and strategic direction
- **Team Level**: Functional teams with specific areas of responsibility
- **Individual Level**: Specific roles with defined responsibilities

#### Role Types
- **Leadership Roles**: Project Manager, Team Lead, Product Owner
- **Specialist Roles**: Developer, Designer, Business Analyst, Data Scientist
- **Support Roles**: Documentation Specialist, QA Tester

#### Hierarchy Definition
- Dynamic hierarchy configuration at project initiation
- Support for matrix organizational structures
- Ability to modify hierarchy as project evolves

### 2. Role Assignment System

#### Role Properties
- **Capabilities**: What actions the role can perform
- **Responsibilities**: What the role is expected to deliver
- **Authority Level**: What decisions the role can make
- **Reporting Relationships**: Who the role reports to and who reports to it

#### Assignment Process
- Initial role assignment during project setup
- Role reassignment mechanism for project evolution
- Temporary role delegation for absences or specific tasks

#### Human-AI Specific Considerations
- Identification of roles best suited for humans vs. AI
- Support for shared roles (human and AI collaboration)
- Handoff protocols between human and AI team members

### 3. Permission Management System

#### Permission Types
- **View Permissions**: What information the role can access
- **Edit Permissions**: What information the role can modify
- **Approve Permissions**: What decisions the role can authorize
- **Assign Permissions**: What tasks the role can delegate

#### Permission Inheritance
- Hierarchical permission inheritance model
- Role-based permission templates
- Project-specific permission overrides

#### Security Considerations
- Sensitive information handling protocols
- Audit trail for permission changes
- Segregation of duties for critical operations

### 4. Communication Framework

#### Communication Channels
- **Synchronous Communication**: Real-time interactions (meetings, chat)
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Delayed interactions (comments, documentation)
- **Structured Communication**: Formal exchanges (approvals, reviews)

#### Adaptation Mechanisms
- AI-to-Human communication optimization
- Human-to-AI communication optimization
- Context preservation across interactions

#### Notification System
- Priority-based notification routing
- Customizable notification preferences
- Escalation paths for critical communications

### 5. Task Management Integration

#### Task Assignment
- Role-based task assignment
- Skill-based task matching
- Workload balancing between human and AI team members

#### Task Tracking
- Unified view of all tasks regardless of assignee type
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Dependency management across human and AI tasks

#### Handoff Protocols
- Clear handoff procedures between human and AI team members
- Context preservation during handoffs
- Quality assurance checkpoints

### 6. Decision-Making Framework

#### Decision Types
- Strategic decisions (project direction)
- Tactical decisions (implementation approach)
- Operational decisions (day-to-day execution)

#### Decision Authority
- Role-based decision authority matrix
- Escalation paths for decisions beyond authority
- Collaborative decision-making protocols

#### Decision Documentation
- Decision record creation and maintenance
- Rationale capture and preservation
- Impact assessment and tracking

## User Interface Design

### 1. Team Management Interface

#### Hierarchy Visualization
- Interactive organization chart
- Role relationship visualization
- Permission and authority indicators

#### Role Management
- Role creation and configuration
- Assignment of team members to roles
- Role modification and evolution tracking

#### Team Dashboard
- Team composition overview
- Activity and contribution metrics
- Performance indicators for human and AI members

### 2. Collaboration Interface

#### Communication Hub
- Unified message center
- Context-aware communication tools
- Translation between human and AI communication styles

#### Task Collaboration
- Shared workspaces for human-AI collaboration
- Real-time collaboration tools
- Version control and change tracking

#### Knowledge Sharing
- Shared knowledge repositories
- Contribution attribution
- Knowledge validation mechanisms

## Integration Points

### 1. Integration with Existing Agent System

#### Agent Adaptation
- Modifications to agent behavior based on role
- Hierarchical awareness in agent decision-making
- Human collaboration protocols for agents

#### Agent Communication
- Enhanced communication capabilities for human interaction
- Context preservation across human-AI exchanges
- Communication style adaptation

### 2. Integration with Jira and Confluence

#### Role Mapping
- Mapping between framework roles and Jira/Confluence permissions
- Consistent role representation across systems
- Synchronized role changes

#### Task Synchronization
- Role-aware task assignment and tracking
- Hierarchical task organization
- Approval workflow integration

#### Documentation Integration
- Role-based document access control
- Hierarchical document organization
- Collaborative editing with role attribution

### 3. Integration with MCP and A2A Technology

#### Protocol Enhancement
- Role-aware conversation protocols
- Hierarchy-based protocol selection
- Human-AI specific protocol adaptations

#### Trust Management
- Role-based trust scoring
- Hierarchical trust inheritance
- Human-AI trust building mechanisms
