# TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT Improvement Prioritization

## Priority Framework

Improvements have been prioritized based on the following criteria:
1. **Impact**: Value delivered to users and the system
2. **Urgency**: How critical the improvement is for system functionality
3. **Complexity**: Implementation difficulty and resource requirements
4. **Dependencies**: Whether other improvements depend on this one

Each improvement is assigned a priority level:
- **P0**: Critical - Must be implemented immediately
- **P1**: High - Should be implemented in the next development cycle
- **P2**: Medium - Important but can be scheduled after P1 items
- **P3**: Low - Valuable but can be implemented later

## Prioritized Improvements

#### 8. Implement Versioning - Upgrade Paths
- **Rationale**: Ensures smooth transitions between versions with moderate complexity.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Upgrade documentation
  - Upgrade scripts
  - Migration tools
- **Timeline Estimate**: 2 weeks

### P3: Lower Priority (Future Enhancements)

#### 9. Expand Agent Roles - Hierarchical Coordination
- **Rationale**: Valuable for large projects but has high complexity and can be built after basic role expansion.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Hierarchical communication framework
  - Role-based authority levels
  - Delegation mechanisms
- **Timeline Estimate**: 3-4 weeks

#### 10. Enhance MCP and A2A - Adaptive Protocols
- **Rationale**: Makes conversations more resilient but has high complexity.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Context-aware protocol selection
  - Protocol adaptation mechanisms
  - Fallback strategies
- **Timeline Estimate**: 3-4 weeks

#### 11. Optimize User Interface - Role-Specific Communication
- **Rationale**: Enables targeted communication but requires significant framework changes.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Direct agent access framework
  - Project Manager notification system
  - Conversation summarization
- **Timeline Estimate**: 2-3 weeks

#### 12. Strengthen Security - Compliance and Audits
- **Rationale**: Important for enterprise adoption but requires specialized knowledge.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - ISO 27001 compliance documentation
  - Audit logging system
  - Security reporting
- **Timeline Estimate**: 3-4 weeks

#### 13. Enhance Tool Integration - Plugin Architecture
- **Rationale**: Greatly increases extensibility but requires significant architectural changes.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Plugin API specification
  - Plugin management system
  - Developer documentation
- **Timeline Estimate**: 4-5 weeks

#### 14. Expand Documentation - Developer Resources
- **Rationale**: Enables ecosystem growth but depends on plugin architecture.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Developer documentation
  - SDK for extensions
  - Code examples
- **Timeline Estimate**: 2-3 weeks

#### 15. Implement Versioning - Version Control
- **Rationale**: Ensures smooth updates but has high complexity.

  - Version management system
- **Timeline Estimate**: 3-4 weeks

## Implementation Waves

### Wave 1 (Immediate Focus)
- Business Analyst & Data Scientist roles
- Knowledge validation & domain-specific knowledge
- Data encryption
- User guides

### Wave 2 (Next Phase)
- Agent onboarding for A2A
- Simplified UI views
- Hardware guidelines
- Upgrade paths documentation

### Wave 3 (Future Development)
- Hierarchical coordination
- Adaptive protocols
- Role-specific communication
- Compliance and audits

## Resource Allocation

Based on the prioritization, we recommend allocating resources as follows:

- **Development**: 70% on Wave 1, 30% on preparation for Wave 2
- **Documentation**: Focus on user guides and hardware guidelines
- **Testing**: Emphasis on security features and new agent roles

## Next Steps

1. Develop detailed implementation plans for Wave 1 improvements
2. Create task breakdown with specific assignees and deadlines
3. Establish metrics to measure the success of each improvement
4. Begin implementation of Wave 1 improvements
