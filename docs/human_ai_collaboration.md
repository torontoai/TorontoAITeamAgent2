# Human-AI Collaboration Features

This document provides an overview of the Human-AI Collaboration features implemented in the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system.

## Personalized Agent Adaptation

The Personalized Agent Adaptation feature enables agents to learn from individual human team members' preferences and working styles, creating a more personalized and effective collaboration experience.

### Key Components

#### UserPreferenceProfile

The `UserPreferenceProfile` class tracks and manages user preferences across multiple dimensions:

- **Communication Style**: Verbosity, formality, technical level, update frequency, and preferred channels
- **Work Style**: Autonomy level, risk tolerance, working hours, task size preferences, and deadline buffers
- **Decision-Making**: Balance between data and intuition, speed vs. accuracy, exploration vs. exploitation
- **Feedback Preferences**: Frequency, criticism style, and level of detail

The profile is continuously updated through:
- Explicit preference settings
- Interaction history analysis
- Satisfaction feedback

#### PersonalizedAgentAdapter

The `PersonalizedAgentAdapter` class modifies agent behavior based on user preferences:

- **Communication Adaptation**: Adjusts message verbosity, formality, and technical level
- **Task Assignment Adaptation**: Modifies task instructions, checkpoints, and deadlines
- **Decision Support Adaptation**: Tailors decision frameworks and information presentation
- **Feedback Adaptation**: Customizes feedback timing, format, and detail level

### Usage Example

```python
# Create a user preference profile
user_profile = UserPreferenceProfile(
    user_id="user123",
    name="John Doe"
)

# Update explicit preferences
user_profile.update_preference(
    category="communication_style",
    preference="verbosity",
    value=0.8  # Prefers detailed communication
)

user_profile.update_preference(
    category="work_style",
    preference="autonomy_level",
    value=0.3  # Prefers more guidance
)

# Record interactions to learn preferences
user_profile.record_interaction(
    interaction_type="message",
    content={"sender": "user", "text": "Please provide more details on this."},
    satisfaction=0.9
)

# Create personalized agent adapter
agent = BaseAgent()  # Your agent implementation
personalized_agent = PersonalizedAgentAdapter(
    base_agent=agent,
    user_profile=user_profile
)

# Generate adapted communication
original_message = "Task completed."
adapted_message = personalized_agent.adapt_communication(original_message)
# Result: A more detailed message based on user's verbosity preference

# Adapt task assignment
task = {
    "title": "Data Analysis",
    "instructions": "Analyze the sales data.",
    "deadline": "2025-05-01T18:00:00Z"
}
adapted_task = personalized_agent.adapt_task_assignment(task)
# Result: More detailed instructions based on user's autonomy preference
```

### Benefits

- **Improved User Satisfaction**: Agents that adapt to individual preferences create a more satisfying experience
- **Increased Productivity**: Alignment with user working styles reduces friction and improves efficiency
- **Better Communication**: Personalized communication reduces misunderstandings and information overload
- **Enhanced Trust**: Users develop stronger trust in agents that understand their preferences

## Collaborative Decision Support

The Collaborative Decision Support feature implements structured frameworks for human-AI joint decision-making, enabling more effective and transparent collaborative decisions.

### Key Components

#### CollaborativeDecision

The `CollaborativeDecision` class represents a decision process with:

- Multiple participants (human and AI) with different roles
- Various decision options with pros, cons, and attributes
- Evaluation criteria with customizable weights
- Structured evaluation process
- Comprehensive decision timeline
- Transparent rationale for final decisions

#### DecisionFrameworks

The system supports multiple decision frameworks:

- **Pros and Cons Analysis**: Simple listing and weighting of advantages and disadvantages
- **Weighted Criteria Matrix**: Evaluating options against multiple weighted criteria
- **Decision Matrix**: Comprehensive comparison across multiple dimensions
- **Scenario Analysis**: Evaluating options under different possible scenarios
- **Delphi Method**: Structured communication technique for consensus building
- **SWOT Analysis**: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating options based on risk profiles
- **Multi-Voting**: Collaborative voting techniques for option selection

#### CollaborativeDecisionSupport

The `CollaborativeDecisionSupport` class provides the main interface for:

- Creating and managing decisions
- Adding participants, options, and criteria
- Recording evaluations and contributions
- Analyzing decision data
- Generating recommendations
- Finalizing decisions with clear rationales

### Usage Example

```python
# Create decision support system
decision_support = CollaborativeDecisionSupport()

# Create a new decision
decision = decision_support.create_decision(
    title="Software Architecture Selection",
    description="Select the best architecture for our new application.",
    framework=DecisionFramework.WEIGHTED_CRITERIA,
    created_by="user_1"
)

# Add participants
human_participant = decision_support.add_participant(
    decision_id=decision.decision_id,
    name="Project Manager",
    role=DecisionParticipantRole.DECISION_MAKER,
    is_ai=False
)

ai_participant = decision_support.add_participant(
    decision_id=decision.decision_id,
    name="AI Architect",
    role=DecisionParticipantRole.ADVISOR,
    is_ai=True,
    expertise=["software_architecture", "scalability", "security"]
)

# Add options
option_a = decision_support.add_option(
    decision_id=decision.decision_id,
    name="Microservices Architecture",
    description="Distributed architecture with independent services.",
    proposed_by=ai_participant.participant_id
)

option_b = decision_support.add_option(
    decision_id=decision.decision_id,
    name="Monolithic Architecture",
    description="Single, unified application with integrated components.",
    proposed_by=human_participant.participant_id
)

# Add criteria
scalability = decision_support.add_criterion(
    decision_id=decision.decision_id,
    name="Scalability",
    description="Ability to handle growing workloads.",
    weight=0.8,
    created_by=human_participant.participant_id
)

maintainability = decision_support.add_criterion(
    decision_id=decision.decision_id,
    name="Maintainability",
    description="Ease of maintenance and updates.",
    weight=0.7,
    created_by=ai_participant.participant_id
)

# Record evaluations
decision_support.record_evaluation(
    decision_id=decision.decision_id,
    participant_id=ai_participant.participant_id,
    option_id=option_a.option_id,
    criterion_id=scalability.criterion_id,
    score=0.9,
    comment="Microservices excel at horizontal scaling."
)

# Generate analysis
analysis = decision_support.analyze_decision(decision.decision_id)

# Finalize decision
decision_support.finalize_decision(
    decision_id=decision.decision_id,
    selected_option_id=option_a.option_id,
    rationale="Selected for superior scalability and maintainability."
)
```

### Benefits

- **Structured Process**: Provides a clear framework for complex decisions
- **Transparency**: Makes the decision process and rationale explicit and traceable
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Combines human expertise with AI capabilities
- **Reduced Bias**: Structured evaluation helps mitigate cognitive biases
- **Better Documentation**: Creates comprehensive records of decision processes
