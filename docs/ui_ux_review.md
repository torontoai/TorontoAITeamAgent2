## User Journey Analysis

### Journey 1: First-Time User Experience

**Current Experience:**
- New users are presented with a complex dashboard without clear guidance
- Project creation options are not immediately apparent
- No clear onboarding or tutorial is provided
- Users must discover system capabilities through trial and error

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement a guided onboarding experience for new users
2. Create a simplified "first project" template with step-by-step guidance
3. Add contextual help throughout the interface
4. Provide sample projects that demonstrate system capabilities
5. Implement a persistent "getting started" guide accessible from the dashboard

### Journey 2: Concept-to-Product Workflow

**Current Experience:**
- The workflow from initial concept to product development is not clearly visualized
- Transitions between different phases (requirements, planning, development) are abrupt
- Users lack visibility into the current phase and next steps
- Feedback opportunities are limited to specific points in the workflow

**Recommendations:**
1. Create a visual workflow map showing the entire concept-to-product journey
2. Implement clear phase transitions with appropriate guidance
3. Add a persistent progress indicator showing current phase and completion status
4. Provide contextual guidance specific to each phase
5. Add continuous feedback mechanisms throughout the workflow

### Journey 3: GitHub Integration and Code Review

**Current Experience:**
- GitHub integration requires technical knowledge to set up
- Code review interface is overly technical and lacks context
- Difficult to track changes and improvements over time
- Limited visualization of code structure and relationships

**Recommendations:**
1. Simplify GitHub connection with guided setup and authentication
2. Create a more visual code review interface with plain language explanations
3. Implement before/after comparisons for code improvements
4. Add visual representation of code structure and dependencies
5. Provide progress tracking for code improvements over time
