# Multi-agent Architecture Search (MaAS) Implementation

This document provides a technical overview of the Multi-agent Architecture Search (MaAS) implementation in the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system.

## Introduction

Multi-agent Architecture Search (MaAS) is an innovative approach to dynamically discover and optimize agent team architectures based on task requirements. Inspired by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in deep learning, MaAS applies similar principles to multi-agent systems, enabling the automatic discovery of effective agent team compositions and communication patterns.

## Technical Implementation

The MaAS implementation consists of several key components:

### 1. Agentic Supernet

The Agentic Supernet is the core component that enables architecture sampling and optimization. It maintains a collection of architecture templates and learns to select and adapt them based on task requirements and performance feedback.

Key features:
- Dynamic architecture sampling based on task complexity and requirements
- Continuous learning from performance feedback
- Support for various architecture patterns (hierarchical, mesh, star, pipeline, hybrid)

Implementation files:
- `/app/orchestration/maas/supernet/agentic_supernet.py`
- `/app/orchestration/maas/supernet/architecture_sampler.py`
- `/app/orchestration/maas/supernet/controller.py`

### 2. Architecture Models

The architecture models define the data structures for representing agent architectures, including agents, connections, roles, capabilities, and tasks.

Key features:
- Comprehensive modeling of agent properties and relationships
- Support for various agent roles and capabilities
- Flexible connection patterns between agents

Implementation files:
- `/app/orchestration/maas/models.py`

### 3. Architecture Templates

Architecture templates provide predefined starting points for architecture search, encoding common patterns and best practices for agent team organization.

Key features:
- Multiple template types for different task domains
- Customizable parameters for each template
- Extensible template registry

Implementation files:
- `/app/orchestration/maas/templates/architecture_templates.py`

### 4. Evaluation System

The evaluation system measures and compares the performance of different agent architectures, providing feedback for the Agentic Supernet.

Key features:
- Comprehensive metrics calculation
- Task-specific fitness functions
- Historical evaluation tracking

Implementation files:
- `/app/orchestration/maas/evaluation/evaluator.py`
- `/app/orchestration/maas/evaluation/metrics.py`
- `/app/orchestration/maas/evaluation/fitness.py`

### 5. Visualization Components

The visualization components provide tools for understanding and analyzing agent architectures and performance metrics.

Key features:
- Interactive and static architecture visualizations
- Performance metric visualizations
- Search progress tracking

Implementation files:
- `/app/orchestration/maas/visualization/architecture_visualizer.py`
- `/app/orchestration/maas/visualization/performance_visualizer.py`
- `/app/orchestration/maas/visualization/search_progress_visualizer.py`

### 6. Integration Layer

The integration layer connects MaAS with existing orchestration frameworks, enabling seamless use with both AutoGen and A2A protocols.

Key features:
- Adapters for AutoGen and A2A frameworks
- Unified interface for framework-agnostic usage
- Workflow execution and monitoring

Implementation files:
- `/app/orchestration/maas/integration/autogen_integration.py`
- `/app/orchestration/maas/integration/a2a_integration.py`
- `/app/orchestration/maas/integration/__init__.py`

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Sampling Process

The architecture sampling process follows these steps:

1. Analyze task requirements and complexity
2. Select an appropriate architecture template
3. Determine the number of agents based on task complexity
4. Assign roles to agents based on required capabilities
5. Create connections between agents based on the template pattern
6. Refine the architecture based on learned parameters

### Evaluation Process

The evaluation process includes:

1. Execute a workflow using the sampled architecture
2. Collect performance metrics (execution time, success rate, quality, etc.)
3. Calculate normalized metrics
4. Compute a fitness score using a task-specific fitness function
5. Store evaluation results for historical comparison
6. Provide feedback to the Agentic Supernet

### Integration with Orchestration Frameworks

The integration with existing frameworks works as follows:

1. Sample an architecture using the Agentic Supernet
2. Convert the architecture to framework-specific configuration
3. Execute the workflow using the framework
4. Collect performance metrics
5. Evaluate the architecture
6. Update the Agentic Supernet with feedback

## Testing

The MaAS implementation includes comprehensive tests to verify its functionality:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for the complete system
- Performance tests for architecture sampling and evaluation

Test files:
- `/tests/test_maas_integration.py`
- `/tests/run_maas_tests.py`

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:

1. Advanced search algorithms (evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning)
2. Meta-learning for cross-task knowledge transfer
3. Distributed evaluation for faster architecture search
4. Interactive architecture design tools
5. Support for additional agent frameworks

## Conclusion

The MaAS implementation provides a powerful mechanism for discovering and optimizing agent team architectures in the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system. By leveraging principles from neural architecture search and applying them to multi-agent systems, MaAS enables dynamic adaptation to different tasks and continuous performance improvement over time.
