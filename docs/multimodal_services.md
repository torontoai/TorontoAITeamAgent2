# Create a design decision with visual options
decision = decision_support.create_decision(
    title="Website Header Design",
    description="Select the best header design for our new website."
)

# Generate visual options
for style in ["minimalist", "bold", "artistic"]:
    image = image_generator.generate(
        prompt=f"Website header design in {style} style with company logo",
        size="1024x256"

    image_path = image_generator.save_image(
        image_data=image.image_data,
        file_path=f"/path/to/header_{style}.png"
    )
    
    # Add as an option to the decision
    decision_support.add_option(
        decision_id=decision.decision_id,
        name=f"{style.capitalize()} Header Design",
        description=f"Header design in {style} style.",
        attachments=[image_path]
    )
```

## Best Practices

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Invest time in crafting effective prompts for image generation
2. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate model for each specific task

6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Design systems that work with text but are enhanced with multimodal capabilities
7. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on generated content to improve future results
8. **Ethical Considerations**: Be mindful of ethical implications of generated content
9. **Performance Optimization**: Balance quality and performance based on requirements
10. **Cost Management**: Monitor API usage to control costs

## Conclusion
