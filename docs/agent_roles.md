## Team Collaboration

The TorontoAITeamAgent system enables these specialized agents to work together seamlessly on complex projects. The collaboration is facilitated through:

1. **Centralized Coordination**: The Project Manager Agent serves as the central coordinator, assigning tasks to the appropriate specialized agents and tracking progress.

2. **Structured Communication**: Agents communicate with each other through a structured communication framework that enables different communication patterns (request-response, broadcast, publish-subscribe).

3. **Role-Based Task Assignment**: Tasks are assigned to agents based on their specialized roles and capabilities, ensuring that each aspect of the project is handled by the most appropriate agent.

4. **Learning Mechanisms**: The system includes learning mechanisms that allow agents to improve their communication and collaboration over time by analyzing past interactions.

5. **Human Oversight**: While agents work autonomously, the human stakeholder maintains oversight through the Project Manager Agent, which serves as the primary interface for human-agent interaction.

## Creating Custom Teams

The TorontoAITeamAgent system allows for the creation of custom teams with different combinations of agent roles based on project requirements. Several pre-configured team templates are available:

1. **Web Development Team**: Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, UI/UX Designer, QA Testing Specialist

2. **Enterprise System Team**: Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, System Architect, Database Engineer, Security Engineer, DevOps Engineer

3. **Data Science Team**: Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, Database Engineer, Performance Engineer

4. **Full Stack Team**: All roles

Custom teams can also be created by selecting specific roles needed for a particular project.

## Integration with Tools

Each agent role is integrated with specific tools that enhance their capabilities:

- **Core AI/LLM Tools**: OpenAI, Ollama, Claude, DeepSeek
- **Agentic Coding Tools**: Aider, Cursor
- **Execution/Testing Tools**: Subprocess, Pytest, Replit
- **Formatting/Style Tools**: Black, Flake8
- **Analysis Tools**: Pylint
- **Type Checking Tools**: MyPy, Pyright
- **Security Tools**: Bandit
- **Deployment Tools**: GitPython, Docker
- **UI/Utilities Tools**: Gradio, Threading, Queue

These tools are dynamically assigned to agents based on their roles and the specific tasks they need to perform.

## Getting Started with Agent Roles

To create a project with a team of specialized agents:

```python
from app.interface.project_manager_interface import ProjectManagerInterface

# Initialize interface
interface = ProjectManagerInterface()

# Create a project with a web development team
result = await interface.create_project({
    "name": "Company Website Redesign",
    "description": "Redesign the company website with modern UI and improved UX",
    "team_composition": [
        "project_manager", 
        "product_manager", 
        "developer", 
        "ui_ux_designer",
        "qa_testing_specialist"
    ],
    "human_stakeholder": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "role": "Marketing Director"
    }
})

project_id = result["project_id"]
```

Once a project is created, the Project Manager Agent will coordinate with the other specialized agents to complete the project tasks, with the human stakeholder interacting only with the Project Manager Agent.
