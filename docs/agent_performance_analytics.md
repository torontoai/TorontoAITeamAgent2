- **Context**: Additional metadata about the circumstances of the metric
- **Task Association**: Optional link to the specific task the metric relates to

### AgentTask

The `AgentTask` class represents tasks assigned to agents:

- **Task Lifecycle**: Tracks the complete lifecycle from creation to completion
- **Status Tracking**: Pending, in-progress, completed, failed, blocked, or cancelled
- **Time Tracking**: Creation time, start time, completion time, and duration
- **Dependencies**: Task dependencies and subtask relationships
- **Performance Metrics**: Associated performance measurements
- **Notes and Tags**: Additional metadata for organization and analysis

### AgentProfile

The `AgentProfile` class maintains a comprehensive profile of an agent's performance:

- **Basic Information**: Agent ID, name, role, and capabilities
- **Performance History**: Historical performance across different metric types
- **Task History**: Record of all tasks assigned to the agent
- **Strengths and Weaknesses**: Identified areas of excellence and improvement

### TeamPerformanceMonitor

The `TeamPerformanceMonitor` class focuses on team-level analytics:

- **Team Composition**: Analysis of team structure and roles
- **Workload Distribution**: Monitoring task allocation across team members
- **Role-Based Performance**: Performance analysis by agent role
- **Team Metrics**: Aggregate performance measurements for the entire team
- **Collaboration Analysis**: Metrics on inter-agent collaboration effectiveness

### PerformanceReport and PerformanceVisualization

These classes provide structured output formats:

- **Individual Reports**: Detailed performance analysis for single agents
- **Team Reports**: Comprehensive team performance summaries
- **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs for various performance metrics
- **Trend Analysis**: Visual representation of performance trends
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparisons between agents, roles, or time periods

## Usage Example

```python
# Create performance analytics system
analytics = PerformanceAnalytics()

# Create agent profiles
developer_agent = analytics.create_agent_profile(
    agent_id="dev_agent_1",
    name="Developer Agent",
    role=AgentRole.DEVELOPER,
    capabilities=["python", "javascript", "api_development"]
)

qa_agent = analytics.create_agent_profile(
    agent_id="qa_agent_1",
    name="QA Agent",
    role=AgentRole.QA_TESTER,
    capabilities=["testing", "bug_reporting", "test_automation"]
)

# Create and assign tasks
dev_task = analytics.create_task(
    agent_id="dev_agent_1",
    title="Implement Authentication API",
    description="Create a secure authentication API endpoint.",
    priority=TaskPriority.HIGH,
    estimated_duration=120.0  # minutes
)

qa_task = analytics.create_task(
    agent_id="qa_agent_1",
    title="Test Authentication API",
    description="Verify the security and functionality of the authentication API.",
    priority=TaskPriority.MEDIUM,
    estimated_duration=90.0  # minutes
)

# Start tasks
analytics.start_task(dev_task.task_id)
analytics.start_task(qa_task.task_id)

# Record metrics during task execution
analytics.record_metric(
    agent_id="dev_agent_1",
    metric_type=MetricType.COMPLETION_TIME,
    value=105.0,
    unit=MetricUnit.MINUTES,
    task_id=dev_task.task_id
)

analytics.record_metric(
    agent_id="dev_agent_1",
    metric_type=MetricType.QUALITY,
    value=92.0,
    unit=MetricUnit.PERCENTAGE,
    task_id=dev_task.task_id
)

# Complete tasks
analytics.complete_task(dev_task.task_id)
analytics.complete_task(qa_task.task_id)

# Generate reports
dev_report = analytics.generate_agent_report("dev_agent_1")
team_report = analytics.generate_team_report(["dev_agent_1", "qa_agent_1"])

# Create visualizations
time_trend = analytics.create_visualization(
    agent_id="dev_agent_1",
    metric_type=MetricType.COMPLETION_TIME,
    chart_type="line",
    title="Completion Time Trend",
    time_period=(start_date, end_date)
)

# Create team performance monitor
team_monitor = TeamPerformanceMonitor(analytics)
team_monitor.add_agent("dev_agent_1")
team_monitor.add_agent("qa_agent_1")

# Get team performance insights
team_summary = team_monitor.get_team_performance_summary()
workload_distribution = team_monitor.get_workload_distribution()
role_performance = team_monitor.get_role_based_performance()
```
