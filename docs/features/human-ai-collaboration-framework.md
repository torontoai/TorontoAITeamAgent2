# Human-AI Collaboration Framework

## Overview

The Human-AI Collaboration Framework enables seamless teamwork between human team members and AI agents within the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system. This framework establishes a hierarchical structure that can be defined at project initiation, allowing for clear roles, responsibilities, and communication channels between all team members, regardless of whether they are human or AI.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Hierarchy**: Clear definition of roles and reporting structures
- **Skill-Based Assignment**: Tasks assigned based on capabilities rather than entity type (human/AI)
- **Transparent Communication**: All team members have visibility into relevant communications
- **Adaptive Workflow**: Framework adapts to changing project needs and team composition
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Seamless knowledge transfer between humans and AI agents
- **Accountability**: Clear tracking of responsibilities and deliverables
- **Jira/Confluence Integration**: Seamless connection with project management and documentation tools

## Hierarchical Structure

The framework supports a flexible hierarchical structure with the following standard roles:

### Leadership Tier
- **Project Sponsor** (Human): Ultimate authority and vision holder
- **Project Manager** (Human or AI): Overall project coordination and responsibility
- **Technical Lead** (Human or AI): Technical direction and architecture decisions

### Core Team Tier
- **Business Analyst** (Human or AI): Requirements gathering and business logic
- **Software Engineer** (Human or AI): Implementation of technical solutions
- **Data Scientist** (Human or AI): Data analysis and model development
- **UX Designer** (Human): User experience and interface design
- **Quality Assurance** (Human or AI): Testing and quality control

### Support Tier
- **Documentation Specialist** (Human or AI): Creating and maintaining documentation
- **DevOps Engineer** (Human or AI): Infrastructure and deployment
- **Knowledge Manager** (Human or AI): Managing and organizing project knowledge

## Architecture

The Human-AI Collaboration Framework consists of several components:

1. **Role Management System**: Defines and manages roles in the team hierarchy
2. **Team Member Management System**: Manages team members and their role assignments
3. **Project Hierarchy Management System**: Manages the team hierarchy for specific projects
4. **Communication Router**: Routes communications between team members based on the hierarchy
5. **Integration with MCP/A2A Frameworks**: Connects with agent communication frameworks
6. **Jira/Confluence Integration**: Integrates with project management and documentation tools

## Usage

### Setting Up Roles

```python
from app.collaboration.hierarchy.role_manager import Role, RoleManager

# Create role manager
role_manager = RoleManager()

# Define roles
project_manager_role = Role(
    role_id="project_manager",
    role_name="Project Manager",
    role_description="Responsible for overall project coordination",
    tier="leadership",
    responsibilities=["Project planning", "Resource allocation", "Status reporting"],
    authority_level="high",
    required_skills=["Project management", "Leadership", "Communication"],
    reports_to="project_sponsor",
    direct_reports=["business_analyst", "software_engineer", "data_scientist"],
    communication_channels=["email", "chat", "meetings"],
    performance_metrics=["Project completion time", "Budget adherence"],
    suitable_for="both"  # Can be assigned to human or AI
)

# Add role to manager
role_manager.add_role(project_manager_role)
```

### Managing Team Members

```python
from app.collaboration.hierarchy.team_manager import TeamMember, TeamManager

# Create team manager
team_manager = TeamManager(role_manager)

# Add human team member
human_member = TeamMember(
    member_id="john.doe@example.com",
    name="John Doe",
    type="human",
    skills=["Project management", "Agile methodologies", "Risk management"],
    experience_level="expert",
    availability="full-time",
    assigned_roles=[],
    preferred_communication_channels=["email", "chat"]
)
team_manager.add_member(human_member)

# Add AI team member
ai_member = TeamMember(
    member_id="data_scientist_agent",
    name="Data Scientist Agent",
    type="ai",
    skills=["Data analysis", "Machine learning", "Statistical modeling"],
    experience_level="expert",
    availability="full-time",
    assigned_roles=[],
    preferred_communication_channels=["api", "chat"]
)
team_manager.add_member(ai_member)

# Assign roles
team_manager.assign_role("john.doe@example.com", "project_manager")
team_manager.assign_role("data_scientist_agent", "data_scientist")
```

### Setting Up Project Hierarchy

```python
from app.collaboration.hierarchy.hierarchy_manager import ProjectHierarchy, HierarchyManager

# Create hierarchy manager
hierarchy_manager = HierarchyManager(role_manager, team_manager)

# Create project hierarchy
project = hierarchy_manager.create_project(
    project_id="project-123",
    project_name="AI Integration Project"
)

# Set up default hierarchy
hierarchy_manager.setup_default_hierarchy("project-123")

# Add role assignments
project.add_role_assignment("leadership", "project_manager", "john.doe@example.com")
project.add_role_assignment("core", "data_scientist", "data_scientist_agent")

# Define communication patterns
project.add_communication_pattern(
    from_role="project_manager",
    to_role="data_scientist",
    primary_channel="chat",
    frequency="daily"
)
```

### Using the Communication Router

```python
from app.collaboration.hierarchy.communication_router import CommunicationRouter

# Create communication router
router = CommunicationRouter(hierarchy_manager)

# Route a message
recipients = router.route_message(
    project_id="project-123",
    from_member_id="john.doe@example.com",
    to_role_id="data_scientist",
    message="Please prepare the data analysis report by tomorrow"
)

# Get appropriate communication channels
channels = router.get_communication_channels(
    project_id="project-123",
    from_role_id="project_manager",
    to_role_id="data_scientist"
)
```

### Integration with MCP/A2A Frameworks

```python
from app.collaboration.hierarchy.mcp_a2a_integration import HierarchyAwareAgent

# Create hierarchy-aware agent
agent = HierarchyAwareAgent(
    agent_id="data_scientist_agent",
    agent_name="Data Scientist Agent",
    hierarchy_manager=hierarchy_manager,
    communication_router=router
)

# Send a hierarchical message
recipients = agent.send_hierarchical_message(
    project_id="project-123",
    to_role_id="project_manager",
    message_content={
        "subject": "Data Analysis Complete",
        "body": "The data analysis has been completed. Results are attached.",
        "attachments": ["analysis_results.pdf"]
    }
)
```

## Human-AI Interaction Patterns

The framework defines several interaction patterns between humans and AI agents:

### 1. Directive Interaction
- **Description**: Human provides specific instructions to AI agent
- **Flow**: Human → AI → Deliverable → Human Review
- **Use Cases**: Well-defined tasks with clear requirements

### 2. Collaborative Interaction
- **Description**: Human and AI work together on a task
- **Flow**: Human ↔ AI ↔ Shared Workspace
- **Use Cases**: Complex problems requiring both human insight and AI capabilities

### 3. Supervisory Interaction
- **Description**: AI performs tasks with human oversight
- **Flow**: AI → Deliverable → Human Review → Feedback → AI
- **Use Cases**: Repetitive tasks where occasional human guidance is needed

### 4. Autonomous Interaction
- **Description**: AI operates independently within defined parameters
- **Flow**: AI → Deliverable → Notification to Human
- **Use Cases**: Well-understood tasks where AI has proven capability

### 5. Learning Interaction
- **Description**: Human teaches AI new skills or domain knowledge
- **Flow**: Human → Knowledge Transfer → AI → Validation
- **Use Cases**: Expanding AI capabilities in new domains

## Role Assignment Process

The framework includes a structured process for assigning roles at project initiation:

1. **Project Analysis**: Assessment of project requirements and complexity
2. **Capability Mapping**: Identification of required skills and available resources
3. **Role Definition**: Creation of project-specific role definitions
4. **Assignment**: Matching team members (human and AI) to roles based on capabilities
5. **Hierarchy Establishment**: Definition of reporting structures and communication channels
6. **Onboarding**: Introduction of team members to their roles and responsibilities

## Integration with Jira and Confluence

The Human-AI Collaboration Framework integrates with Jira and Confluence to:

### Jira Integration

1. **Map Roles to Jira Users**: Each team member (human or AI) has a corresponding Jira user
2. **Reflect Hierarchy in Workflows**: Approval processes follow the defined hierarchy
3. **Track Assignments**: Tasks are assigned based on role responsibilities
4. **Monitor Performance**: Role performance metrics are tracked through Jira reports

### Confluence Integration

1. **Document Team Structure**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of the team hierarchy
2. **Share Knowledge**: Facilitate knowledge sharing between humans and AI agents
3. **Record Decisions**: Document decision-making processes and outcomes
4. **Maintain Role Definitions**: Keep role definitions and responsibilities current

## Technical Implementation

The framework is implemented using the following data models:
