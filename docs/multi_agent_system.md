# TorontoAITeamAgent Team AI - Multi-Agent System Documentation

## Overview

TorontoAITeamAgent Team AI is an advanced multi-agent system designed to enable multiple specialized agents to collaborate effectively on complex projects. The system implements a team-based approach where agents are assigned specific roles (such as Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, System Architect, etc.) and work together autonomously with minimal human intervention.

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the multi-agent system architecture, agent roles, communication framework, and deployment instructions.

## Architecture

The TorontoAITeamAgent Team AI architecture consists of several key components:

### 1. Multi-Agent System

The core of the system is the `MultiAgentSystem` class, which manages the creation and coordination of agent teams. It handles:

- Project creation and management
- Agent instantiation and role assignment
- Message routing between agents
- Task distribution and tracking
- Project status monitoring

### 2. Agent Communication Framework

The `AgentCommunicationFramework` enables structured communication between agents with:

- Multiple communication patterns (request-response, broadcast, publish-subscribe)
- Message formatting and routing
- Delivery mechanisms with retry capabilities
- Structured message templates for different interaction types

### 3. Learning Mechanisms

The `AgentLearningMechanisms` allow agents to improve their communication and collaboration over time by:

- Analyzing past communications
- Identifying improvement opportunities
- Enhancing prompts with learned improvements
- Adapting to team dynamics

### 4. Project Manager Interface

The `ProjectManagerInterface` serves as the central point of communication between human stakeholders and the agent team:

- Handles all human-to-agent communication
- Routes messages to the Project Manager agent
- Provides status updates and message history
- Offers visibility into agent thinking processes

### 5. Agent Role Integration

The `AgentRoleIntegration` component manages the integration of all agent roles:

- Creates teams with different role compositions
- Defines role interactions and communication patterns
- Provides specialized team templates for different project types
- Handles task assignment to teams

## Agent Roles

TorontoAITeamAgent Team AI supports the following agent roles:

### Core Roles

1. **Project Manager**: Central coordinator who interfaces with human stakeholders and manages the overall project.
2. **Product Manager**: Focuses on requirements, user stories, and product vision.
3. **Developer**: Implements code, fixes bugs, and handles technical implementation.

### Specialized Roles

4. **System Architect**: Designs high-level system architecture and makes technical decisions.
5. **DevOps Engineer**: Handles CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure, and deployment.
6. **QA/Testing Specialist**: Creates test plans, test cases, and ensures quality.
7. **Security Engineer**: Focuses on security best practices and vulnerability assessment.
8. **Database Engineer**: Designs database schemas and optimizes data storage.
9. **UI/UX Designer**: Creates wireframes, mockups, and user experience flows.
10. **Documentation Specialist**: Creates comprehensive technical documentation.
11. **Performance Engineer**: Optimizes system performance and conducts benchmarking.

## Team Compositions

The system provides several pre-configured team templates:

1. **Default Team**: Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer
2. **Web Development Team**: Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, UI/UX Designer, QA Testing Specialist
3. **Enterprise System Team**: Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, System Architect, Database Engineer, Security Engineer, DevOps Engineer
4. **Data Science Team**: Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, Database Engineer, Performance Engineer
5. **Full Stack Team**: All roles

## Communication Flow

The communication flow in TorontoAITeamAgent Team AI follows these principles:

1. Human stakeholders communicate exclusively with the Project Manager agent
2. The Project Manager coordinates with all other agents
3. Agents communicate with each other based on defined role interactions
4. All communication is structured and tracked for learning and improvement

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Project with a Team

```python
from app.interface.project_manager_interface import ProjectManagerInterface

# Initialize interface
interface = ProjectManagerInterface()

# Create a project with a web development team
result = await interface.create_project({
    "name": "Company Website Redesign",
    "description": "Redesign the company website with modern UI and improved UX",
    "team_composition": ["project_manager", "product_manager", "developer", "ui_ux_designer"],
    "human_stakeholder": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "role": "Marketing Director"
    }
})

project_id = result["project_id"]
```

### Sending a Message to the Project Manager

```python
# Send a message to the project manager
result = await interface.send_message_to_project_manager({
    "project_id": project_id,
    "message": "I need a landing page that highlights our new product features",
    "attachments": ["/path/to/brand_guidelines.pdf"]
})
```

### Getting Messages from the Project Manager

```python
# Get messages from the project manager
result = await interface.get_messages_from_project_manager({
    "project_id": project_id,
    "timeout": 1.0
})

for message in result["messages"]:
    print(f"Message from Project Manager: {message['content']}")
```

### Running a Learning Cycle

```python
# Run a learning cycle to improve agent communication
result = await interface.run_learning_cycle({
    "project_id": project_id
})

print(f"Learning cycle completed with {len(result['improvements'])} improvements")
```

## Testing

The system includes a comprehensive test suite to verify all components work together properly:

```python
from app.tests.multi_agent_system_test import run_tests

# Run all tests
results = await run_tests()

print(f"Tests completed: {results['successful_tests']}/{results['total_tests']} successful")
```

## Advanced Features

### Agent Thinking Visibility

The system provides visibility into agent thinking processes:

```python
# Get the thinking process of an agent
result = await interface.get_agent_thinking({
    "project_id": project_id,
    "agent_role": "developer"
})

for thought in result["thinking"]:
    print(f"[{thought['step']}] {thought['content']}")
```

### Custom Team Composition

```python
from app.integration.agent_role_integration import AgentRoleIntegration

# Initialize integration
integration = AgentRoleIntegration()

# Create a custom team
result = await integration.create_team({
    "name": "Security-Focused Team",
    "description": "A team focused on security-critical applications",
    "custom_roles": [
        "project_manager",
        "developer",
        "security_engineer",
        "qa_testing_specialist",
        "devops_engineer"
    ]
})
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**: Ensure all API keys are correctly configured in `config.yaml`
2. **Model Availability**: Check that the specified models are available for your API keys
3. **GitHub Authentication**: Verify that your GitHub token has the necessary permissions
4. **Memory Usage**: For large projects, monitor memory usage as multiple agents can consume significant resources

### Logs

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory with different log levels:

- `debug.log`: Detailed debugging information
- `info.log`: General information about system operation
- `error.log`: Errors and exceptions
