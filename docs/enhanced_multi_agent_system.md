### Human Input Request System

The Human Input Request System provides a structured way for agents to request information from humans through the Project Manager, who prioritizes and manages these requests.

#### Key Features

- **Itemized Request List**: A collapsible panel displays all pending human input requests, organized by priority.
- **Request Filtering**: Requests can be filtered by agent, category, priority, and status.
- **Request Details**: Each request includes detailed information about what input is needed, why it's needed, and how it will be used.
- **Status Tracking**: The system tracks the status of each request (pending, in progress, completed) and notifies agents when responses are available.
- **Project Manager Filtering**: The Project Manager can filter and reformulate requests before presenting them to the human user, ensuring clarity and relevance.

## Project Manager Communication Flow

The Project Manager Communication Flow ensures that all agent requests for human input are routed through the Project Manager, who acts as the central point of contact between the agent team and the human user.

### Key Features

- **Centralized Communication**: All requests for human input are routed through the Project Manager, providing a single point of contact.
- **Request Reformulation**: The Project Manager can reformulate requests to ensure clarity and provide necessary context.
- **Priority Management**: The Project Manager prioritizes requests based on urgency, impact, and project timeline.
- **Response Distribution**: When human input is received, the Project Manager distributes the information to the relevant agents.
- **Follow-up Management**: The Project Manager tracks whether requests have been adequately addressed and follows up when necessary.

### Example Usage

```python
# Initialize the PM communication flow
pm_communication_flow = ProjectManagerCommunicationFlow()

# Register agents
for agent_id, agent_data in agents.items():
    await pm_communication_flow.register_agent(agent_data)

# Submit a human input request
request_params = {
    "from_agent": "dev-001",
    "to_agent": "pm-001",
    "request_type": "clarification",
    "content": "Need clarification on authentication requirements. Should we support social login?",
    "priority": "medium",
    "context": {
        "feature": "authentication",

    }
}
request_result = await pm_communication_flow.submit_human_input_request(request_params)

# Get pending human input requests
pending_result = await pm_communication_flow.get_pending_human_input_requests({})

# Submit human response
response_params = {
    "request_id": request_id,
    "response": "Yes, please implement social login with Google and GitHub options.",
    "from_human": True
}
response_result = await pm_communication_flow.submit_human_response(response_params)
```

## Request Prioritization Mechanism

The Request Prioritization Mechanism ensures that human input requests are prioritized based on various factors, allowing the most critical requests to be addressed first.

### Key Features

- **Multi-factor Prioritization**: Requests are prioritized based on urgency, impact, agent role, request age, and complexity.
- **Dynamic Reprioritization**: The system can dynamically reprioritize requests as new information becomes available or as project priorities change.
- **Category-based Prioritization**: Different categories of requests (e.g., decisions, clarifications, approvals) can have different prioritization rules.
- **Urgency Detection**: The system can detect urgent requests based on content analysis and context.
- **Impact Assessment**: The system assesses the potential impact of each request on the project timeline and quality.

### Example Usage

```python
# Initialize the request prioritization mechanism
request_prioritization = RequestPrioritizationMechanism()

# Add a request
request = {
    "id": "req-001",
    "from_agent": "dev-001",
    "to_agent": "pm-001",
    "request_type": "clarification",
    "content": "Need clarification on authentication requirements.",
    "priority": "medium",
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "context": {
        "feature": "authentication",
        "current_task": "implementation_planning"
    }
}
await request_prioritization.add_request(request)

# Get prioritized requests
prioritization_params = {
    "max_requests": 10
}
prioritization_result = await request_prioritization.get_prioritized_requests(prioritization_params)

# Mark a request as resolved
resolve_params = {
    "request_id": "req-001",
    "resolution": "Clarified authentication requirements.",
    "resolved_by": "pm-001"
}
resolve_result = await request_prioritization.mark_request_resolved(resolve_params)
