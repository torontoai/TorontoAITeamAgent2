# MCP and A2A Technology Overview

## Introduction

The TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system has been enhanced with sophisticated Multi-agent Conversational Protocols (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) technology to enable structured, secure, and efficient collaboration between agents. This document provides an overview of these technologies, their implementation, and how to use them in your agent-based applications.

## Multi-agent Conversational Protocols (MCP)

MCP provides a formal framework for structured conversations between agents, ensuring that interactions follow predefined protocols with clear states and transitions. This enables more reliable and predictable agent interactions, especially for complex collaborative tasks.

### Key Components

1. **Protocol States**: Formal states that define valid messages and transitions in a conversation
2. **Conversation Protocols**: Templates for different types of agent interactions
3. **Conversation Context**: Tracks the state and history of ongoing conversations
4. **Conversation Manager**: Manages active conversations and protocol registrations

### Standard Protocols

The MCP framework includes five standard protocols:

1. **Information Exchange Protocol**: For requesting and providing information
2. **Negotiation Protocol**: For proposals, counter-proposals, and agreements
3. **Task Delegation Protocol**: For assigning, accepting, and completing tasks
4. **Collaborative Problem Solving Protocol**: For joint problem-solving activities
5. **Error Handling Protocol**: For reporting and resolving errors

### Usage Example

```python
from app.collaboration.mcp_framework import ConversationManager
from app.collaboration.mcp_a2a_integration import IntegratedCommunicationSystem

# Initialize the integrated system
system = IntegratedCommunicationSystem()
await system.initialize()

# Start a conversation using the task delegation protocol
result = await system.start_conversation(
    thread_id="thread_123",
    protocol_type="task",
    participants=[
        {"id": "manager", "role": "manager"},
        {"id": "worker", "role": "worker"}
    ]
)

# Send a message within the conversation
message = Message(
    id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
    sender="manager",
    recipients=["worker"],
    subject="Data Analysis Task",
    content="Please analyze the Q1 sales data",
    type=MessageType.TASK,
    data={"task_id": "T123", "deadline": "2025-04-15"}
)

message.metadata = {
    "thread_id": "thread_123",
    "sender_role": "manager",
    "recipient_role_worker": "worker"
}

await system.send_message(message)
```

## Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Technology

A2A technology enables agents to discover each other's capabilities, establish trust relationships, and communicate securely. This creates a dynamic ecosystem where agents can find the most suitable collaborators for specific tasks.

### Key Components

1. **Capability Registry**: Manages agent capabilities and provides discovery services
2. **Trust Manager**: Tracks interaction outcomes and calculates trust scores
3. **Security Manager**: Handles authentication, authorization, and secure messaging
4. **Agent Identity**: Represents an agent's identity, role, and capabilities

### Capability Discovery

Agents can register their capabilities and discover other agents with specific skills:

```python
# Register an agent with capabilities
result = await system.register_agent(
    agent_id="developer1",
    role="developer",
    name="Developer Agent",
    description="Python developer",
    capabilities=[
        {
            "name": "Python Development",
            "description": "Ability to write Python code",
            "parameters": {"languages": ["Python"], "experience_years": 5},
            "semantic_tags": ["programming", "python", "development"]
        }
    ]
)

# Find agents for a specific task
result = await system.find_agents_for_task(
    task_description="Need to write Python code for data analysis",
    required_capabilities=["python", "programming"]
)
```

### Trust Management

The A2A framework includes a sophisticated trust management system:

```python
# Record a successful interaction
result = await system.update_agent_trust(
    source_id="manager",
    target_id="worker",
    interaction_type="task_completion",
    outcome="success"
)

# Get trust information
trust_info = await system.get_agent_trust("manager", "worker")
reputation = await system.get_agent_reputation("worker")
```

### Secure Messaging

Messages can be sent securely between agents:

```python
# Send a secure message
result = await system.send_message(message, secure=True)
```

## Integration with Existing System

The MCP and A2A frameworks are fully integrated with the existing communication system through adapters and a unified interface:

1. **MCPAdapter**: Translates between standard messages and MCP format
2. **A2AAdapter**: Connects A2A framework with agent registry and communication
3. **IntegratedCommunicationSystem**: Provides a unified interface for all functionality

## Benefits

1. **Structured Conversations**: Formal protocols ensure reliable agent interactions
2. **Capability-based Collaboration**: Agents can find the best collaborators for tasks
3. **Trust-based Decision Making**: Interaction history informs collaboration choices
4. **Secure Communications**: All messages are authenticated and can be encrypted
5. **Unified Interface**: Simple API for accessing all collaboration features

## Advanced Features

1. **Semantic Capability Matching**: Find agents based on semantic understanding of capabilities
2. **Trust Decay**: Recent interactions have more influence on trust scores
3. **Hybrid Protocol Support**: Combine multiple protocols for complex interactions
4. **Conversation History**: Track and analyze conversation patterns
5. **Security Policies**: Fine-grained access control for agent operations

## Maintenance

The system includes automated maintenance tasks:

```python
# Run maintenance tasks
result = await system.maintenance_tasks()
```

This performs:
1. Cleaning expired capabilities
2. Updating trust models
3. Archiving old conversations

## Conclusion

The MCP and A2A technologies provide a powerful foundation for sophisticated agent collaboration in the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system. By enabling structured conversations, capability discovery, trust management, and secure communications, these technologies create a more effective and reliable multi-agent environment.
