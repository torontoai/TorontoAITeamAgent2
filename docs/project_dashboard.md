## Integration with Multi-Agent System

The dashboard is fully integrated with the TORONTO AI Team Agent Team AI multi-agent system:

- **Real-time Updates**: The dashboard receives real-time updates from agents
- **Project Manager as Central Point**: All dashboard interactions are routed through the Project Manager agent
- **Agent Coordination**: The Project Manager coordinates with other agents based on user input
- **Intelligent Notifications**: Critical issues requiring human attention are highlighted
- **Decision Support**: The dashboard presents options for key decisions with recommendations from agents

## Unique Features for Multi-Agent Context

The dashboard includes features specifically designed for a multi-agent system:

- **Agent Thinking Visibility**: Option to see agent reasoning processes for important decisions
- **Predictive Intelligence**: Project Manager agent anticipates potential issues before they arise
- **Adaptive Interface**: Dashboard adapts based on project phase and user preferences
- **Collaborative Decision Making**: Framework for gathering input from multiple agents on key decisions
- **Autonomous Progress Reporting**: Automated generation of progress reports by the Project Manager

## Technical Implementation

The dashboard is implemented using React and Material-UI components:

- **Component Structure**:
  - `ProjectDashboard`: Main dashboard component
  - `ProjectOverviewPanel`: Project overview component
  - `ProgressTrackingVisualizations`: Progress tracking component
  - `ProjectManagerInteractionInterface`: PM interaction component
  - `AgentConversationMonitoringPanel`: Agent conversation component
  - `SprintTrackingVisualization`: Sprint tracking component
  - `DashboardIntegration`: Integration with agent communication system

- **Data Flow**:
  - Dashboard components receive data from the agent communication system
  - User interactions are sent to the Project Manager agent
  - Real-time updates are received through subscriptions to relevant topics

- **State Management**:
  - Each component maintains its own state for UI interactions
  - The `DashboardIntegration` component manages the overall application state
  - Real-time updates are handled through the agent communication service

## Getting Started

To use the Project Dashboard:

1. Ensure the TORONTO AI Team Agent Team AI system is properly set up and running
2. Navigate to the dashboard URL in your web browser
3. The dashboard will automatically connect to the agent communication system
4. Use the various components to monitor project progress and interact with agents

## Best Practices

- **Regular Check-ins**: Review the dashboard regularly to stay informed about project progress
- **Timely Responses**: Respond to requests from agents promptly to avoid delays
- **Proactive Communication**: Use the chat interface to communicate with the Project Manager about any concerns
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use the visualizations to make informed decisions about the project
- **Delegation**: Allow agents to handle routine tasks while focusing on strategic decisions

## Troubleshooting

- **Loading Issues**: If the dashboard fails to load, check your connection to the agent communication system
- **Data Discrepancies**: Use the refresh buttons to ensure you have the latest data
- **Communication Problems**: If messages aren't being delivered, check the agent status indicators
