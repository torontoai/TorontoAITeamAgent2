# Deployment Strategy

This document outlines the strategic approach for deploying the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system in various environments, from development to production.

## Deployment Phases

The deployment of the TORONTO AI TEAM AGENT system is organized into four phases:

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Environment configuration
- Security setup
- Database preparation
- Network configuration

### Phase 2: Initial Deployment
- Backend deployment
- Frontend deployment
- Integration testing
- Initial validation

### Phase 3: Validation and Optimization
- Performance testing
- Security validation
- User acceptance testing
- System optimization

### Phase 4: Production Release
- Final deployment
- Monitoring setup
- Backup configuration
- Documentation finalization
- User training

## Deployment Environments

### Development Environment
- Purpose: Active development and feature testing
- Scale: Single-node deployment
- Configuration: Debug mode enabled, minimal resources
- Access: Limited to development team

### Testing Environment
- Purpose: Integration testing and QA
- Scale: Multi-node deployment (smaller scale)
- Configuration: Production-like with test data
- Access: QA team and stakeholders

### Staging Environment
- Purpose: Pre-production validation
- Scale: Production-equivalent deployment
- Configuration: Mirror of production
- Access: Limited stakeholders for final validation

### Production Environment
- Purpose: Live system for end users
- Scale: Full multi-node deployment with redundancy
- Configuration: Optimized for performance and security
- Access: End users and administrators

## Deployment Methods

### Manual Deployment
- Suitable for development environment
- Step-by-step process documented in [Local Deployment Guide](./local-deployment.md)
- Allows for rapid iteration and debugging

### Containerized Deployment
- Suitable for testing and staging environments
- Docker containers for consistent environments
- Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration
- Enables easy environment replication

### Orchestrated Deployment
- Suitable for production environment
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Helm charts for deployment management
- Provides scaling, redundancy, and automated recovery

## Rollout Strategy

### Phased Rollout
1. **Alpha Release**: Internal team only
2. **Beta Release**: Limited external users
3. **General Availability**: All users

### Rollback Plan
- Automated rollback triggers based on monitoring metrics
- Manual rollback procedures documented
- Database backup and restore procedures
- Version control for all configuration

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- User activity monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking

### Maintenance Windows
- Scheduled maintenance during low-usage periods
- Advance notification to users
- Rolling updates to minimize downtime
- Automated testing post-maintenance

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
- Role-based access control
- API key rotation schedule
- Session management and timeout policies

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits
- Vulnerability scanning
- Compliance with relevant regulations

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Regular database backups
- Configuration backups
- Code repository backups
- Offsite backup storage

### Recovery Procedures
- Documented recovery procedures
- Regular recovery testing
- Recovery time objectives (RTO)
- Recovery point objectives (RPO)

## Next Steps

- Review the [Local Deployment Guide](./local-deployment.md) for development setup
- Review the [Production Deployment Guide](./production-deployment.md) for production setup
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting/common-issues.md) for deployment issues
