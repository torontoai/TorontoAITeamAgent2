semgrep_scanner = SemgrepScanner()

security_scanning_manager.register_scanner(snyk_scanner)
security_scanning_manager.register_scanner(sonarqube_scanner)
security_scanning_manager.register_scanner(semgrep_scanner)

# Scan a project with Snyk
snyk_result = security_scanning_manager.scan(
    target="/path/to/project",
    scanner_type=SecurityScannerType.SNYK

# Print scan results
print(f"Scan completed in {snyk_result.scan_duration:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Found {len(snyk_result.vulnerabilities)} vulnerabilities:")
print(f"  Critical: {snyk_result.critical_count}")
print(f"  High: {snyk_result.high_count}")
print(f"  Medium: {snyk_result.medium_count}")
print(f"  Low: {snyk_result.low_count}")
print(f"  Info: {snyk_result.info_count}")

# Initialize the audit trail system
audit_storage = SQLiteAuditEventStorage("/path/to/audit.db")
audit_trail_system = AuditTrailSystem(audit_storage)

# Log an agent action
audit_trail_system.log_agent_action(
    agent_id="agent1",
    action="code_generation",
    resource="project/file.py",
    status="success",
    severity=AuditEventSeverity.INFO,
    details={"language": "python", "tokens": 150}

# Log a security event
audit_trail_system.log_security_event(
    actor="user2",
    action="permission_change",
    resource="project/sensitive.py",
    status="success",
    severity=AuditEventSeverity.HIGH,
    details={"old_permissions": "rw-r--r--", "new_permissions": "rw-rw-r--"},
