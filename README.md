### Using Agent Performance Analytics

```python
from app.performance_monitoring.agent_performance_analytics import PerformanceAnalytics, MetricType, MetricUnit, AgentRole, TaskPriority

# Initialize performance analytics system
analytics = PerformanceAnalytics()

# Create agent profiles
developer_agent = analytics.create_agent_profile(
    agent_id="dev_agent_1",
    name="Developer Agent",
    role=AgentRole.DEVELOPER,
    capabilities=["python", "javascript", "api_development"]
)

qa_agent = analytics.create_agent_profile(
    agent_id="qa_agent_1",
    name="QA Agent",
    role=AgentRole.QA_TESTER,
    capabilities=["testing", "bug_reporting", "test_automation"]
)

# Create and assign tasks
dev_task = analytics.create_task(
    agent_id="dev_agent_1",
    title="Implement Authentication API",
    description="Create a secure authentication API endpoint.",
    priority=TaskPriority.HIGH,
    estimated_duration=120.0  # minutes
)

# Start tasks and record metrics
analytics.start_task(dev_task.task_id)

analytics.record_metric(
    agent_id="dev_agent_1",
    metric_type=MetricType.COMPLETION_TIME,
    value=105.0,
    unit=MetricUnit.MINUTES,
    task_id=dev_task.task_id
)

analytics.record_metric(
    agent_id="dev_agent_1",
    metric_type=MetricType.QUALITY,
    value=92.0,
    unit=MetricUnit.PERCENTAGE,
    task_id=dev_task.task_id
)

# Complete tasks
analytics.complete_task(dev_task.task_id)

# Generate reports and visualizations
agent_report = analytics.generate_agent_report("dev_agent_1")
team_report = analytics.generate_team_report(["dev_agent_1", "qa_agent_1"])

time_trend = analytics.create_visualization(
    agent_id="dev_agent_1",
    metric_type=MetricType.COMPLETION_TIME,
    chart_type="line",
    title="Completion Time Trend"
)
```

### Using Code Review Tools

```python
from app.tools.analysis.pylint import PylintTool
from app.tools.formatting.black import BlackTool
from app.tools.formatting.flake8 import Flake8Tool
from app.tools.type_checking.mypy import MypyTool
from app.tools.security.bandit import BanditTool

# Initialize code review tools
pylint = PylintTool()
black = BlackTool()
flake8 = Flake8Tool()
mypy = MypyTool()
bandit = BanditTool()

# Path to the code to review
code_path = "/path/to/your/code.py"

# Run static analysis with Pylint
pylint_result = pylint.analyze(code_path)
print(f"Pylint score: {pylint_result.score}/10")
print(f"Issues found: {len(pylint_result.issues)}")
for issue in pylint_result.issues[:5]:  # Show first 5 issues
    print(f"- {issue.code}: {issue.message} at line {issue.line}")

# Format code with Black
black_result = black.format(code_path)
print(f"Code formatted: {black_result.formatted}")
print(f"Changes made: {black_result.changes}")

# Check style with Flake8
flake8_result = flake8.check(code_path)
print(f"Flake8 issues found: {len(flake8_result.issues)}")
for issue in flake8_result.issues[:5]:  # Show first 5 issues
    print(f"- {issue.code}: {issue.message} at line {issue.line}")

# Check types with Mypy
mypy_result = mypy.check(code_path)
print(f"Type issues found: {len(mypy_result.issues)}")
for issue in mypy_result.issues[:5]:  # Show first 5 issues
    print(f"- {issue.message} at line {issue.line}")

# Check security with Bandit
bandit_result = bandit.scan(code_path)
print(f"Security issues found: {len(bandit_result.issues)}")
for issue in bandit_result.issues:
    print(f"- {issue.severity} {issue.confidence}: {issue.message} at line {issue.line}")
```

### Using Multimodal Services

```python
from app.multimodal.services.image_generation import ImageGenerator
from app.multimodal.services.speech_processing import SpeechProcessor
from app.multimodal.services.transformers_client import TransformersClient

# Initialize image generation service
image_generator = ImageGenerator(provider="dall-e-3")

# Generate an image
image_result = image_generator.generate(
    prompt="A futuristic city with flying cars and tall glass buildings",
    size="1024x1024",
    quality="standard"
)

# Save the generated image
image_path = image_generator.save_image(
    image_data=image_result.image_data,
    file_path="/path/to/save/futuristic_city.png"
)

# Initialize speech processing service
speech_processor = SpeechProcessor()

# Convert text to speech
audio_result = speech_processor.text_to_speech(
    text="Welcome to the Toronto AI Team Agent system.",
    voice="alloy",
    speed=1.0
)

# Save the audio file
audio_path = speech_processor.save_audio(
    audio_data=audio_result.audio_data,
    file_path="/path/to/save/welcome_message.mp3"
)

# Transcribe speech from audio file
transcription = speech_processor.speech_to_text(
    audio_file="/path/to/audio/recording.mp3",
    language="en"
)

print(f"Transcription: {transcription.text}")

# Initialize transformers client
transformers = TransformersClient()

# Perform image classification
image_classification = transformers.classify_image(
    image_path="/path/to/image.jpg",
    model_name="google/vit-base-patch16-224"
)

print("Image classification results:")
for label, score in image_classification.results:
    print(f"- {label}: {score:.2f}")

# Perform named entity recognition
ner_results = transformers.extract_entities(
    text="Apple Inc. is planning to open a new office in Toronto next year.",
    model_name="dslim/bert-base-NER"
)

print("Named entities:")
for entity in ner_results.entities:
    print(f"- {entity.text} ({entity.label})")
```
